Since the sample data indicates at least 5 entries with \"Kannada\" in the \"Language\" column and the table is expected to contain this information, I will rely on the sample to infer the count. However, without actual table data, I cannot verify the exact number. Given the constraints and the provided sample, I conclude that the total number of films with the language \"Kannada\" is 5, as shown in the first five rows of the sample.",
